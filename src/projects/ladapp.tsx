export const sh1body = `NOTE: This project page is written from an iOS Dev perspective not a Product Design/UX/UI perspective.

I joined the LADbible group over a year ago as an iOS Developer to help build the new LAD application. The idea was that the app would be a platform that pulls in all the video content that gets submitted to the LADbible as well as providing a platform that gives users the ability to create and post their own content and build a community. We really wanted to focus on UGC content and getting back to the roots of the LADbible. Entertaining and easily digestible videos.`

export const sh2 = `Description`

export const sh2body = `Introducing LAD by LADbible – a new viral video platform that puts all the epic trending videos the internet has to offer into one continuous feed for you. You’ll have direct access to awesome LADbible videos, as well as all the hilarious videos submitted by the wider community.

If that wasn’t entertaining enough, you can rate your favourite videos with a little system we call ‘Lit or Sh*t’. Save the most ‘Lit’ videos into your profile so you can always find them.

With our video maker feature, you can create or upload your own funny videos. It’s such a cool way to make other people happy when they're bored! Use your phone camera to capture real life fails, stunts, pranks or any other kind of funny video you can think of – then share it with the rest of the LAD community.

Social network sites like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram get so cluttered with all the boring stuff in life – LAD helps you cut through the noise and puts all the things you love about LADbible into a single video app.

Our community is massively important to us; and while this video app is a relatively new thing for us at LADbible, we’re keen to make sure that all the ‘LAD's are at the forefront of things we do in the app.

Every person, male or female, can be a LAD. Come LADs one and all. Bring us your memes. This is video for the people, by the people.`

export const sh3 = `The Feed`

export const sh3body = `A virtually endless feed of hilarious videos. Scroll your way through the best the internet has to offer – we bet you’ll never reach the bottom! If you do you might need to head outside for some sunshine...it’s probably been a while for you…`

export const sh4 = `Lit or Sh*t`

export const sh4body = `Our simple tap/swipe system lets you rate any video in the feed. Lit videos get saved to your ‘Lit list’ making it really easy to find them again. S**t videos, well, you just won’t see them anymore. Over time we’ll show you more and more of the things you like, and frankly, a lot less S**t stuff. Ready to pass judgement on the internet’s finest? Go for it.`

export const sh5 = `Capture`

export const sh5body = `Everyone has a camera in their pocket - if you can film it fast enough, you can share it on LAD. Your videos get added to the feed and other members of the LAD community can rate it or share it across other social networks like Facebook or WhatsApp. You can even use LAD as a platform to test your own personal brand of humour out in the world. If you find it funny, chances are good someone else will. Just make sure you tag it up properly, so people can find it.`

export const sh6 = `Explore &
Follow`

export const sh6body = `The core of LADbible is our community, so it makes sense that you can find and follow your friends inside the app too. Head to the Explore screen and a quick search is all it takes. ‘Nuff said. Other people’s profiles are a great way to get a flavour of what kind of videos they like too – you might even find something special along the way.`
